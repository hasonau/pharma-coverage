    // if req.query.city then add it to object otherwise not
    // same goes for next ones,other filters right,i dk how to do that,but will learn with ur help

// ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ve Learned (From Search Feature Work)

// Using query parameters (req.query)

// Learned how frontend sends filters like ?city=Lahore&urgency=high and how to extract them.

// Dynamic query building in MongoDB

// Understood how to build a query object conditionally (if (city) query.city = city), so filters are applied only if provided.

// Date filtering with MongoDB operators

// Learned to use $gte (greater than or equal) and $lte (less than or equal) for date ranges.

// Flexible filtering behavior

// Realized how the query works even if only one of start or end is provided â€” it still produces correct results.

// Role-aware querying concept

// Noted that pharmacies should see only their own shifts, which means adding pharmacyId: req.user.id later.

// Importance of structured defaults

// Discussed having default filters (like showing city-based or open shifts first) to avoid empty UI.

// Progressive learning mindset

// You intentionally avoided writing full code blocks, focusing on thinking and reasoning first, which solidifies memory of syntax and logic.
