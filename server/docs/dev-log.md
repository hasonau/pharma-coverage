# DAY 1 â€“ Project Setup

## Setup

- Basic **project initialization** completed.
- Installed core dependencies (`express`, `mongoose`, `dotenv`, `cors`, etc.).
- Folder structure created: `models`, `routes`, `controllers`, `middleware`, `config`,`db`,`utils`.

## Utilities Implemented

- **Cloudinary**
  - Integrated in `utils` for **future image uploads**.
- **APIError Class**
  - Standardized error handling across the project.
  - Ensures consistent error responses instead of different formats.

- **APIResponse Class**
  - Generic response class.
  - Allows sending structured responses consistently.

  ## File Upload Setup

- **Multer**: middleware to handle temporary file uploads to `./public/temp`.
- **Cloudinary**: configured for cloud storage of files/images.
- `uploadOnCloudinary` function handles uploading local files to Cloudinary and removing the temp file if upload fails.

## Notes on Async Handling

- **No asyncHandler used**, because **Express 5** now automatically handles async route errors with try/catch.

# DAY 2 â€“ Authentication System

## Models & Utilities

- **User model (Pharmacy)** with validation and required fields.
- **Password hashing** implemented in model (pre-save hook).
- **JWT utilities**: `generateToken` and `verifyToken` for token creation and verification.
- **Cookie helper**: sets JWT in httpOnly, secure cookies.

## Controllers & Routes

- **Register API (Pharmacy)**
  - Validates required fields.
  - Checks for duplicate emails.
  - Creates a new pharmacy user.
  - Generates JWT token and sets it in cookie.
  - Returns structured response with minimal user info (name, email).

- **Login API (Pharmacy)**
  - Validates email and password.
  - Generates JWT token and sets it in cookie.
  - Returns structured success response.

- **Routes**
  - `POST /api/pharmacy/Register` â†’ Register pharmacy
  - `POST /api/pharmacy/Login` â†’ Login pharmacy

## Testing & Verification

- Registration and login tested in Postman.
- Cookie set successfully after registration and login.
- Duplicate email registration returns proper error.
- Login works only with correct JSON payload (`email`, `password`).

## Auth Middleware

- Extracts JWT token from cookies.
- If no token â†’ throws `401 Unauthorized`.
- If invalid token â†’ throws `401 Invalid Token`.
- If valid â†’ decodes token, attaches `req.user` (id + role) for downstream routes.

## Protected Route Example

- Added `/api/pharmacy/protected`.
- Uses `authMiddleware`.
- Returns `user` info from decoded token if access is granted.

## Verification Done

- Tested flow:
  - Register/Login â†’ token set in cookies.
  - Hitting `/protected` with token â†’ success.
  - Without token â†’ error response.

# DAY 3 â€“ Core Models & Validation (Amendments)

## Model Updates

### Pharmacy Model

- Added **location fields** for better shift filtering and future geo-based features:
  - `addressLine` (String, required)
  - `city` (String, required)
  - `state` (String, optional)
  - `country` (String, required)
  - `postalCode` (String, optional)

### Pharmacist Model

- Added the same **location fields** as Pharmacy:
  - `addressLine`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `postalCode`

## Controller Updates

### RegisterPharmacy

- Now validates that `addressLine`, `city`, and `country` are provided during registration.
- Ensures more complete data collection for location-based features.

## Reasoning Behind Changes

- These fields will allow **location-aware filtering** of shifts later (e.g., pharmacists see nearby pharmacies).
- Provides better user experience by avoiding irrelevant shift listings.
- Keeps the schema future-proof for geolocation enhancements (distance-based search, city filters).
